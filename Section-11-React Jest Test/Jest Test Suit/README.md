# React Webpack Boilerplate

This is an as simple as possible boilerplate for getting up and running with React via Webpack. The purpose of this is for quickly prototyping with all the goodness of the NPM system at your disposal.

## Setup Guide

`git clone git@github.com:jarsbe/react-webpack-boilerplate.git app`

`cd app`

`npm install`

`npm install webpack -g`

`npm start`

Webpack is now watching your project for changes and a Python server is running.

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and you should be good to go!
